# Machine Learning Regression Task

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Code
1. Place the dataset file (`TASK-ML-INTERN.csv`) in the project directory.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## Models Implemented

- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **LightGBM Regressor**
- **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)**
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- **Graph Neural Network-like Dense Model (GNN)**

## Results and Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using:

- **R² Score**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

For detailed analysis, check the results printed in the console or refer to the `output/` directory.

### How to Add README to GitHub

1. Create a `README.md` file in your project directory:
   ```bash
   touch README.md
   ```
2. Open `README.md` and paste the above content.
3. Save the file and add it to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add project README"
   git push origin main
   ```
